Create impulsions (an impulsion is low logic level) on a pin of the uC. Pin is alternativelly low and high (with a duration of 0.5 s). Uses interrupt (non blocking). Create 10 pulses and then stops.

At present state, works on an Arduino NG (Atmega8 @ 16 MHz). The pin is PB5 (Arduino pin 13 witch has a built-in led).
